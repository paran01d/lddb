## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository
2. Start with Docker Compose: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Access securely at **https://cooee.mankies.com** (or http://localhost:8090 for local testing)
4. Start scanning LaserDisc barcodes with secure camera access!

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Go dependencies: `go mod download`  
3. Run the application: `go run cmd/server/main.go`
4. Open http://localhost:8082 (or whatever port it finds) in your browser

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the application  
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Rebuild after changes
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### SSL Configuration

**For Local Network Access:**
1. Add to your `/etc/hosts` file: `127.0.0.1 grave.local`  
2. Access at **https://grave.local** with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL
3. Camera access will work securely on mobile devices

**For Production Deployment:**
1. Point your domain DNS A record to your server's public IP
2. Update `Caddyfile` with your domain name
3. Caddy automatically handles Let's Encrypt certificates
4. HTTPS enforced for secure camera API access

**Why HTTPS is Important:**
- Modern browsers require HTTPS for camera/microphone access
- Mobile devices need secure context for barcode scanning
- Let's Encrypt provides free, automatic SSL certificates
- Enhanced security for your LaserDisc collection data
